:computer: Backend API Server
This repository contains a simple yet robust Backend API Server developed using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It features basic user authentication functionalities such as registration and login.  

:wrench: Setup Instructions  
To get this server up and running on your local machine, follow the steps mentioned below:  

Clone this repository to your local machine:  

git clone https://github.com/username/reponame.git  
Move into the project directory:  

cd reponame  
Install the dependencies:  

npm install  
Start the server:  
sql  

npm start  
The server will run on port 8080 and will connect to a MongoDB database. On successful setup, 'Server is running on port 8080' will be logged in your terminal.  

:file_folder: Project Structure  
package.json: Lists the project dependencies and scripts.  

server.js: Entry point for the server. Sets up our Express app and MongoDB connection. Includes middleware settings and connects our authentication routes.  

models/: Contains schema definitions for MongoDB documents. We have a User schema (Users.js) which includes pre-save hooks for hashing passwords.  

routes/: Contains route definitions. We have authentication routes (auth.js) which include user registration and login.  

:lock: Key Dependencies  
express: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.  

mongoose: An elegant MongoDB object modeling tool.  

bcrypt: A library to hash passwords.  

body-parser: Body parsing middleware.  

cors: Middleware to enable CORS with various options.  

jsonwebtoken: An implementation of JSON Web Tokens.  

:globe_with_meridians: Endpoints  
Our server handles the following endpoints:  

POST /auth/register: Registers a new user by saving them to the database. The password is hashed before storing.  

POST /auth/login: Authenticates a user. If the username and password combination is valid, a success message is returned.  

:warning: Security Note: Please replace the MongoDB connection string in server.js with your own. Always keep sensitive data like your MongoDB connection string secure, and avoid committing them directly to your version control system.  

:white_check_mark: Tests  
Currently, no test suite is included. You'll find a placeholder script for testing in the package.json file, which should be updated as per your project's requirements.  

Feel free to fork or clone this project for your needs. Happy coding! :rocket:
